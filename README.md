# open-speed-test
I am sick and tired of not being able to run a basic speed test from my Nvidia Shields. I am building an open-source app that does that. NO ADS AND NO DNS THEFT

Netflix Speed Tester: https://fast.com/#

**From HBOmax**

Android TV: On your Android TV, go to Apps and download an internet speed test app to test your connection speed (or test your speed from a computer on the same network). To do this, open a browser on your computer and search for 'internet speed test.'

There isn't a good Android TV (Google Play Store) app that is not horrible or sketchy as hell. 

I think if I find the public catalog APIs or something similar, I can run a speed test against that. I can have a single window app that tests the connecction with speed.cloudflare.com and then a GREEN | RED dot next to major services. 

Two buttons
1) Run Speed Test
2) Run Extended Speed Test
    Tests all the service speeds and such
    
I think download speed is good for now, but maybe add in upload, ping, jitter, etc... with plain language advice about what could be wrong. 

V2 of this should have a monitor on the major streaming sites to say if they are up or down. 

So.... FEC's official speed test/broadband map is down...

V1 of all this is a super basic speed tester. 
Name of app: speed tester
